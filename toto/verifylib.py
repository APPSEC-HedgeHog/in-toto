<Purpose>

  Provides a library to verify a Toto final product containing
  a software supply chain layout.

  The library provides functions to:
    - verify signatures of a layout
    - verify signatures of a link
    - verify if the expected command of a step aligns with the actual command
      as recorded in the link metadata file.
    - run inspections (records link metadata)
    - verify product or material matchrules for steps or inspections

    Extracts all inspections from a passed Layout's inspect field and

    returned as a dictionary with the according inspection names as keys and
    the Link metadata objects as values.
